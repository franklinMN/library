✅ STAGE 1 — Absolute Basics (School-Level Foundation)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````
You must master these to understand higher-level physics.
This gives you intuition about how things move in space.

	TOPICS:

	BOOKS:
		1. Concepts of Physics — H.C. Verma (Vol 1) → Perfect for fundamentals
		2. Physics for Scientists and Engineers — Serway & Jewett
		3. University Physics — Young & Freedman (gold standard)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ STAGE 2 — NASA Core: Classical Mechanics
````````````````````````````````````````````
This is the MOST important for spacecraft, rockets, drones, robotics.
Everything that flies obeys Newton + gravity.
Flight software uses these equations constantly.

	TOPICS:
		- Forces in 3D
		- Rotational motion

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ STAGE 4 — Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
````````````````````````````````````````````
Critical for space thermal control — spacecraft can freeze or overheat easily.
Helps in understanding:
	Thermal protection on spacecraft
	Designing electronics that survive vacuum
	Battery & fuel temperature management

	TOPICS:
		- Temperature, heat flow

`````````````````````````````````````````````
Essential for understanding rockets, propulsion, aerodynamics.
Used in:
	Rocket software
	Atmospheric entry
	Drone & aircraft control
	Fuel management

	TOPICS:
		- Fluid pressure
		- Fluid flow (laminar, turbulent)
		- Bernoulli’s principle
		- Drag & lift
		- Rocket equation (Tsiolkovsky)
		- Nozzle flow
		- Propulsion systems

	BOOKS:
		1. Fundamentals of Aerodynamics — John D. Anderson
		2. Introduction to Flight — Anderson

This connects everything to actual space missions.
This is EXACTLY what NASA engineers use to write flight software.

	TOPICS:
		- Orbital mechanics
		- Satellite dynamics and attitude control
		- Control systems (PID, state-space, Kalman filters)
		- Astrodynamics
		- Spacecraft systems engineering
		- Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC)
