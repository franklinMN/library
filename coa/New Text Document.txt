Yes, all these topics—**assembly language, CPU design, instruction sets (ARM, x86), memory hierarchy, and STM32 microcontrollers**—fall under **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)**. 

### What’s the Difference?
- **Computer Architecture**: Focuses on the *functional* aspects—what the system does.  
  Includes: **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), registers, addressing modes, data types**. 
- **Computer Organization**: Focuses on *implementation*—how hardware is structured to execute the architecture.  
  Includes: **Control units, data paths, memory systems, buses, ALU design**. 

### Where to Study?
Start with structured resources:
1. **"Computer Organization and Design" by Patterson & Hennessy** – The standard textbook. 
2. **"Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective" (CS:APP)** – Great for software-focused learners. 
3. **"Digital Design" by Morris Mano** – For logic gates and digital circuits. 

### Online Resources:
- **Nand2Tetris** – Hands-on journey from logic gates to a working computer. 
- **Coursera/edX courses** on COA from top universities.
